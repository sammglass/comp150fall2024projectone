# Assuing we go with the visual novel idea, then each of these location files will be an event with Mothman/Bigfoot
# looking at the existing text in the file, I am getting some ideas for how the flow of the game will go
# probably, there will be three events with both Mothman/bigfoot. Depending on how many events that the player passes, that will determine the ending of the game
